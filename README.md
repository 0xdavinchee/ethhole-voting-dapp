# ethhole-voting-dapp
Create a dapp for voting where all of the votes and candidate registration happens on chain. 

Allow anyone to start an election with a registration period, voting period, and ending time. 

Allow anyone to sign up as a candidate during the registration period, and allow anyone to 
vote once during the voting period. Create a front end where voters can see the results and 
know how long is left in the election.

Assumptions:
- Multiple elections can be started by anyone.
- Anyone can sign up as a candidate (and only be part of one election).
- Voters can only vote in one election.
- Registration Starts immediately after an election is created.
- Voting starts immediately following the registration period.
